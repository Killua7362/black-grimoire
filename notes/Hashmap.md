# Why Hashmap takes constant look time

## Load Factor 

It is the measure of how much size is left in hashmap before rehashes and doubles the size. 

then there wont be rehashing in future
So low load factor means more hashing in future so no more collissions but more lookups.
Hashmap creates buckets that means every element is unique so computer knows where that element is exactly!
But sometime bad hashmap means all elments in single bucket and not constant time lookup
