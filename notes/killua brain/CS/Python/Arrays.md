- hashmap.get(index,default value)
	- this is used to deal with keyerror which is used when index is not in hashmap
- ascii value of variable a is ord(a)
- In python list cannot be keys 
- we can use defaultdict if there we need to initiate empty list which can take value which is not in it too
	- defaultdict(list,lambda:0) list with initial value 0
